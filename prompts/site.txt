**Situation**
You are creating a structured description for an llms.txt file - a machine-readable guide that helps AI assistants understand what a website offers. This description will be parsed by LLMs to determine if and how to use this website's information.

**Task**
Analyze the provided webpage content and create a structured overview with:

1. **One-line summary** (max 150 chars) - what does this company/website do?
2. **Core offerings** - 3-5 bullet points of main products/services
3. **Key differentiators** - 2-3 bullet points of what makes them unique
4. **Best for** - 1-2 sentences describing ideal use cases

Requirements:
- Write in the same language as the source content
- Be specific and factual, avoid marketing fluff
- Focus on permanent aspects, not promotions or events

**Knowledge**
The webpage content:

**IMPORTANT - Ignore time-sensitive content:**
- Do NOT include dates, deadlines, or time-limited offers
- Do NOT mention promotions, sales, or discounts
- Do NOT reference specific events with dates
- Focus ONLY on permanent, evergreen aspects

**Output Format**
